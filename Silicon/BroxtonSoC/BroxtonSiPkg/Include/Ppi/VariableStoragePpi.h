/**
  Return the next variable name and GUID.

  This function is called multiple times to retrieve the VariableName
  and VariableGuid of all variables currently available in the system.
  On each call, the previous results are passed into the interface,
  and, on return, the interface returns the data for the next
  interface. When the entire variable list has been returned,
  EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.

  @param[in, out] VariableName           On entry, a pointer to a null-terminated string that is the
                                         variable's name. On return, points to the next variable's

  @param[in, out] VariableGuid           On entry, a pointer to an EFI_GUID that is the variable's GUID.
                                         On return, a pointer to the next variable's GUID.
  @param[out]     VariableAttributes     A pointer to the variable attributes.

  @retval         EFI_SUCCESS            The variable was read successfully.

  @retval         EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL   The VariableNameSize is too small for the resulting
                                         data. VariableNameSize is updated with the size
