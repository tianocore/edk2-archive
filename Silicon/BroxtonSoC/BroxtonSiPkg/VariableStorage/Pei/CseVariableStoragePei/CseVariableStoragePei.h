/**
  Return the next variable name and GUID.

  This function is called multiple times to retrieve the VariableName
  and VariableGuid of all variables currently available in the system.
  On each call, the previous results are passed into the interface,
  and, on return, the interface returns the data for the next
  interface. When the entire variable list has been returned,
  EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.

  @param[in, out] VariableNameSize       On entry, points to the size of the buffer pointed to by

  @param[in, out] VariableName           On entry, a pointer to a null-terminated string that is the
                                         variable's name. On return, points to the next variable's
