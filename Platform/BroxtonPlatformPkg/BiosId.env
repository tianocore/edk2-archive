## @file
#  This file is used to define the BIOS ID parameters of the build.
#  This file is processed by GenBiosId.
#  Here, it is just a template and can be customized by user.
#  The BIOS ID format conforms to "BIOS Revision Identification Specification", Rev. 2.0, 01/30/2015.
#
#  BIOS ID string format:
#    $(BOARD_ID)$(BOARD_REV).$(BOARD_EXT).$(VERSION_MAJOR).$(BUILD_TYPE)$(VERSION_MINOR).YYMMDDHHMM
#  All fields must have a fixed length. YYMMDDHHMM is UTC time.
#    Example: "TRFTCRB1.000.0008.D03.1501301017"
#
#  If DATE is specified for YYMMDD and TIME is specified for HHMM like below,
#  GenBiosId will use the value of DATE and TIME to fill YYMMDDHHMM,
#  otherwise GenBiosId will fill YYMMDDHHMM with current UTC time of the build machine.
#    DATE          = 150130
#    TIME          = 1017
